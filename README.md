# credit-risk-classification

## Project Description
 - This assignment uses Visual Studio to look loan data to assess credit risk for potential clients. Visual Studio was used to import the file and display the required data. The information was then used to create a logistic regression model. The created models gave further insight of how to read the data followed by specific questions about the information that were asked and answered.
## Summary of Contents
### Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
 - Read the lending_data.csv data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame
 - Create the labels set (y) from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features (X) DataFrame from the remaining columns
 - Split the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split
### Logistic Regression Model 
 - Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (X_train and y_train)
 - Save the predictions on the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (X_test) and the fitted model
 - Generate a confusion matrix
 - Generate a classification report
 - Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels? 
### Credit Risk Analysis Report
 - Provide an overview that explains the purpose of this analysis
 - Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Included my justification for recommending the model for use by the company
## Getting Started
 - This assignment uses Visual Studio with the obtained data and creates the required logistic regression models required.
